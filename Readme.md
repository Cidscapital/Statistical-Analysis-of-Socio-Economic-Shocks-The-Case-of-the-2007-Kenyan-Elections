**Project Title:** Statistical Analysis of Socio-Economic Shocks: The Case of the 2007 Kenyan Elections

**Abstract**
This study applies advanced statistical computing techniques to measure the impact of the 2007 General Elections on Kenya's economic stability. By analyzing time-series data regarding Quarterly GDP Growth and Tourism Revenue, we quantify the magnitude and duration of the post-election regression. The project adopts a tri-language methodology—integrating Python, R, and Julia—to optimize specific stages of the data pipeline, from acquisition to high-performance simulation.

**Methodology & Structure**
The analysis is divided into three distinct phases, each utilizing the programming language best suited for the task:

1.  **Data Acquisition & EDA (Python - `folder_one`):** Efficient handling of raw data and initial exploratory analysis.
2.  **Statistical Inference (R - `folder_two`):** rigorous modeling (ARIMA) and generation of high-quality visual outputs.
3.  **Simulation & Benchmarking (Julia - `folder_three`):** Modeling post-shock recovery dynamics using high-performance computing.

### Key Improvements Made:
* **Standardized IDs:** Changed mixed casing (Bsccs/bsccs) to a uniform `BSCCS` for professionalism.
* **Visual Hierarchy:** Used bolding and bullet points to make the languages and folders easier to scan.
* **Clarity:** Refined the language to sound more active (e.g., "demonstrate mastery" instead of "we demonstrate mastery").
* **Context:** Explicitly labeled what the "Folders" contain in the header (e.g., adding `(Python)` next to `folder_one`).
